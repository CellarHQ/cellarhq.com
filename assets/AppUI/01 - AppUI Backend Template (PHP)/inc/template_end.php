/**
 * template_end.php
 *
 * Author: pixelcave
 *
 * The last block of code used in every page of the template
 *
 * We put it in a separate file for consistency. The reason we
 * separated template_scripts.php and template_end.php is for enabling us
 * put between them extra javascript code needed only in specific pages
