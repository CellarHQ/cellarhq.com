We tried every beer imaginable.  We read about beer. We talked about beer. We began making our own beer.  And finally we started talking and dreaming about opening a brewery on the North Fork.<br><br>In the Spring of 2008 the dream became a reality when Rich heard about an old firehouse for sale in the Village of Greenport.  Driven by thirst more than brains, we bought the building in the middle of what has been called a Global Economic Meltdown.   Next we started the renovation.  Did we mention Global Economic Meltdown?  We tried to do most of the work ourselves and luckily got a lot of help from some good friends and family. <br>The promise of beer can be powerful. Our luck continued when on a snowy January day, with no roof on our brewery, we got a visit from DJ Swanson and his 2 young children. No one in their right mind would have joined us. DJ did and agreed to be our new head brewer. In April with roof replaced, windows installed, and drains dug, our brew house arrived and the idea of making Greenport Harbor beer began. Four months later in July of 2009 we were officially shipping (hand truck and family cars) our beer.<br><br>Today our beer is served in over 200 places on Lon g Island (thank you Justin) and NYC.<br><br>We&rsquo;re proud to say that since summer of 2009 we have been singled out for nearly every beer we have brewed from the Village Voice to the Tasting Table to TimeOut NY to Newsday to NY Examiner to Wall Street Journal to countless beer and food blogs.<br>We have a total of 13 employees if you include our forklift and delivery truck, which we do.

We installed a 7 barrel brewery and served our first handcrafted beer brewed on the premises in October of 1992. In July of 1997, we celebrated our 10th anniversary by opening another location in Carlsbad. We expanded our brewing capacity into the building next door creating the opportunity to brew, bottle, distribute, and drink even more. Our distribution center is called PORT BREWING!  We found the perfect location in San Clemente  and opened in July of 2003 enabling us to brew several additional styles! Let''s party! When people started asking where they could get our beer besides Pizza Port enough, we acquired the old Stone Brewing facility in San Marcos at 155 Mata Way #104 to expand our distribution as PORT BREWING! We officially opened on Cinco de Mayo 2006. Now we will be able to make up to 10,000 barrels to get out to your other favorite places to enjoy coldies!

At its peak, the Potosi Brewery had grown to be the fifth largest in Wisconsin, shipping a variety of labels including Good Old Potosi, Holiday, Garten Brau, Augsburger and others to destinations throughout the United States. In 1972 the brewery ceased operations and closed its doors.<br><br>The restoration of the Potosi Brewery began in 1995 when Gary David bought the ruined Potosi Brewery Bottling buildings. This nearly one sq uare block of buildings had just suffered a major fire and most of the buildings were a total loss. After working three years to rebuild parts of what had been destroyed, Gary then turned his attention to the Brewery itself. Being awarded the high bid at the county auction he then enlisted the help of his friend Rick Tobin and cousin Denis David. It was the marketing genius of Denis and his wife Madonna in 1999 that brought the public on board through a community meeting. This meeting was overwhelmingly attended by the public and brought forth numerous suggestions as well as additional support. It was this gathering of the public that led to the formation of the Potosi Brewery Foundation in February of 2000.<br><br>In 2004, with restoration  underway, the Potosi Brewery Foundation was selected by the American Breweriana Association to be the home to its national museum.

Throughout the running of these side-by-side businesses, Doug always had brewing on his mind and began to experiment in 2002 with home brewing.  Receiving excellent feedback on his brews from several beer aficionados, Roosterfish Brewing&rsquo;s first official beer, Black Walnut Nut Brown Ale (now known as Original Nut Brown Al e) was unveiled at the Crooked Rooster and Wildflower Caf&eacute; in 2004.  This was shortly followed with the Butternut Pale Ale, now known as Dog Tooth Pale Ale.

In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA  was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States.

     VALUES ('BREWERY', 'the-olde-mecklenburg-brewery', 'The Olde Mecklenburg Brewery', 'Premium quality beer requires premium quality ingredients, and there are only four ingredients that should go into beer (Barley or wheat malt, hops, yeast and pure water).  That&rsquo;s why the Germans created the original Beer Purity Law in 1516 (the &ldquo;Reinheitsgebot&rdquo;), which prohibits the use of inferior ingredients. OMB adheres strictly to the Reinheitsgebot. We do not and will never cheapen our beer with inferior ingredients like corn or rice that lower the cost but ruin the flavor, head and body of the beer (next time you&rsquo;re drinking a glass of bottled water that''s being sold as &ldquo;beer,&rdquo; check the ingredients on the label). <br><br>Premium beer also requires intensive, costly brewing methods. Decoction might  sound like a nasty medical procedure, but it is actually an important method of obtaining a full-bodied, flavor rich beer. Trouble is, it takes time (and costs money) so most brewers skip this step. But if the malt starches and proteins are not converted just right, the beer simply won&rsquo;t be as good.  OMB is committed to making only the best beer possible.  We will not take shortcuts in the brewing process that save time and money but result in unbalanced, watery beers lacking in flavor, body or aroma.<br><br>Finally, all OMB beers are lagered (cold conditioned) on the yeast after primary fermentation.  This process requires expensive storage (lager) tanks which have to be kept cold (around 32 F) year round.  However, the results are  worth it.  The difference between a beer just after primary fermentation and one that''s been lagered for three weeks is enormous.', null,

John Thomas Toohey and his brother James Matthew ran pubs in Melbourne (The Limerick Arms and The Great Britain) before moving to Sydney in the 1860s. They commenced brewing Tooheys Tooheys Black Old Ale in a brewery in the area of present day Darling Harbour. By 1875, demand for their beer had soared and they established The Standard Brewery in inner-city Surry Hills. In 1902, the company went public as Tooheys Limited,  and commenced brewing lager (the present day Tooheys New) in 1930. In 1955, the brewery moved west to Lidcombe, where it is currently sited. In 1967, Tooheys bought competitor Miller''s Brewers located in Tavener''s Hill, closing the brewery in 1975.', 1869,

We ignore costs, fads, and difficulty in creating our ales. And, while we are very serious about the art and business of beer making, we try to avoid taking ourselves too seriously. After all, we real ize brewing a fine beer isn''t exactly nuclear physics. It''s something far more important. -Twistedpine.com', 1995,

We think we’ve met that goal, &amp; hope you’ll agree. At Aftershock, we believe there are two different approaches to brewing. The most common approach used by the major breweries is a ‘scientific one’. All stages of the brewing process are closely monitored to ensure a consistent, if tasteless product. Computers and other high tech equipment are more in control than the brewer himself. With this approach you get ‘scient ific’ beer. The other approach is a more artistic one, while still respecting basic laws of science, and the need for spotless cleanliness. That’s the approach we plan to always take at Aftershock. At the risk of losing an undetectable amount of consistency, the result is beer with much more character, subtle nuances, and awesome flavor. Don’t take our word for it; check us out.', null,

Unfortunately, in 655, while travelling through the charcoal forest, across the territory of what is now the town of Le Roeulx, Feuillien was martyred and beheaded.

The Abbey prospered until the upheavals of the French Revolution. During these troubled times, it was condemned by the revolutionaries.

All of our mead, ciders, dessert mead and braggots-honey ales, are produced using the finest honey available without the addition of added sulfites. Our braggots are styled after many traditional ales but with a major twist - there is lots of honey added during fermentation. Sometimes up to 50% of the fermentable sugar. In many cases while they are modeled after more traditional styles, they are unique and stand on the ir own. Typically lower in hop aroma and bitterness to allow the honey to shine they are still quite enjoyable.

Our Apple Cyser, a hard apple and honey cider our classic dry mead and our sweet Wildflower honey mead.

Aside from our personal preferences for the beer, there are also practical reasons for going all-sour. By focusing completely on sour beer, we can concentrate on learning as much as possible about the reasons why those unique flavors are produced in sours. With our entire focus on sours, we have crafted a cellar around the production of sour beer. Our space is dedicated to the conditioning of barrel-aged sour beers. With high ceilings, a moderate cl imate and plenty of space, we give our barrels an ideal home to create their unique flavors. It’s been said that constraint breeds creativity.

     VALUES ('BREWERY', 'rushing-duck', 'Rushing Duck', 'Rushing Duck Brewing Company started as an idea in a college dorm room in 2006. Founder, Dan Hitchcock was disillusioned by the fact that to enjoy a beer with friends, that meant having to drink bland, mass-produced adjunct lagers. He knew that there was bolder, more flavorful beer out there, but not yet being 21 he had no way to get it. To combat this problem, he decided he’d just make his own. He enlisted the help of his very supportive parents, and soon after he and his dad, Les, were brewing beer. Like most novice homebrewers, the initial creations were barely a notch above drinkable. The room for improvement only fueled their desire to brew better and more consistent beer. Dan began spending more and more time reading, researching, and  studying anything he could get his hands on in order to make better beer. While still enrolled in college for political science, Dan decided that brewing professionally was what he wanted to do for a living, so before even graduating he applied to the American Brewer’s Guild for a degree in Intensive Brewing Science &amp; Engineering. While taking the American Brewer’s Guild’s distant learning program, Dan was also getting on the job training as a cellarman at Weyerbacher Brewing Co. in Easton, PA. After finishing the Brewer’s Guild program and getting a promotion to lead brewer at Weyerbacher, Dan began to focus again on opening his own brewery. He spent the better part of two years writing and rewriting a business plan. Finally in the su mmer of 2011 he and Les decided to pull the trigger and open up Rushing Duck Brewing Company. Since then they along with a lot of support (both mentally and physically) from friends and family have been working tirelessly to prepare for a Summer 2012 opening! What the Hell is a Duck and Why is it Rushing? Our name comes from a Hoboken, NJ colloquialism that my grandfather told me about. In the post-prohibition era it was common for people to go to their neighborhood bar and get a container filled with draught beer to bring home to drink. This is not unlike the “growlers” that are common now. However, the containers back then did not have to be any specific size, shape, or material unlike the 64 oz glass growlers that we are familiar with. I n fact, the container did not even have to have a lid. My grandfather’s container of choice was a metal pail that he and his buddies dubbed a “Duck”. Occasionally, while sitting around playing cards, tragedy would strike, and the “Duck” would become empty. It was then the job of the low man on the totem pole to rush down to the bar to get a refill. Thus was born the phrase, “rushing the duck.” As a nod to both my family history, and the culture of the early to mid 20th century we’ve adopted the name…Rushing Duck Brewing Company. Rush over to our tasting room and get your duck filled!', 2012,

Since then we have planted over 1,000 apple trees, created 5 vintages of Eden Vermont Ice Ciders, and have introduced a new line of Orleans Aperitif Ciders. Our goals are to create healthy soils and trees in our own orchard, to support our Verm ont apple orchard partners who do the same, to minimize our carbon footprint, to contribute to the economic and environmental health of our employees and our Northeast Kingdom community, and most of all to make world-class unique ciders that truly reflect our Vermont terroir.', 2007,

     VALUES ('BREWERY', 'peckhams-cider', 'Peckham''s Cider', 'Caroline and Alex Peckham are cider drinkers originally from England, and therefore know real cider that’s made from fruit grown just for cidermaking. After moving to New Zealand, they struggled to find anything that came close to what they drank in the UK, so in 2007, they moved their family to the beautiful Upper Moutere, near the town of Nelson (a region heavy with fruit of all sorts – right across their dirt road is the world famous Neudorf Vineyards), and took over a tiny orchard growing apples, pears and boysenberries. They chose this particular spot because the Moutere clay on which the orchard sits was sure to grow fruit with intense flavors. The orchard wasn’t quite suited to the kind of cider they wanted to make, however, as it wa s mainly host to fruit grown for eating, rather than cider-making. So for the first four years, the Peckhams set out on a quest to locate heirloom fruit, not an easy task on the island nation of New Zealand. Strict regulations make it near impossible to introduce something as potentially threatening to native species as live apple trees, so importing scion wood for grafting from England, France, or Spain was out of the question. Years ago, however, when the island was first settled by none other than the British, no such regulations existed, and, as such, relics of an English cider-drinking past still exist in the form of heritage trees, spread across the country. So the Peckhams set out in search of run down orchards across New Zealand tha t might be hiding excellent fruit suited to cider making. They collected scion wood from as many varieties of trees as they could find, brought it back to the Upper Moutere, and grafted it onto their own orchard. They now tend their fruit as organically as possible, and craft their vintage cider almost entirely from heritage fruit grown in their orchard, including boysenberries as well as black currants from a neighbor down the road. Their cider is a vintage product made from tree-ripened, heritage cider apples. The juice is slow fermented in the autumn (which being in the Southern Hemisphere, is concurrent with our springtime) and left to mature through the winter for six to nine months.', 2007,

Although a winery, Otway Estate has embraced beer and brewing as much as the love of fine wine. Blessed with the availability of pure Otway rainwater, we brew all of our beers with this ''gift from the gods''. It is well known that you need good water to make good beer and there''s nothing better than water from the lush rainforest. The brewery was commissioned in February 2007 with the release of the first two beers took place in March 2007. At Prickly Moses Handcrafted Beer, we believe that beer is diverse in its colour, aroma and flavour and is not just limited to &quot;yellow fizzy stuff&quot;. We c reate beers to match an appearance, aroma and flavour profile - not a budget - so we use the best possible ingredients we can find. Our repetoire of exciting beer recipes continuously grows and we''re always keen to try something new. We also believe that food is an important part of the craft beer experience and we''re always trying to pair good food with our great beer. We hope you enjoy our beer as much as we enjoy brewing it for you.', 2007,

We hope to brew two batches on most days, and are currently only brewing ales. As of now, the beer we will provide include stouts, porters, ESBs, IPAs, pale ales, wheat beers, and herb-based brews, among others.

About three years ago he delved into home brewing as a long time connoisseur, first level Sommelier, and Certified Beer server. As with many things in his life, he took his passion for brewing to the extreme. After reading over 15 books on home brewing and attending classes at UC Davis Extension he experimented with a myriad of hop and grain combinations to create a flagship IPA…this today is the Andro meda IPA.

     VALUES ('BREWERY', 'holy-mackerel-brewing', 'Holy Mackerel Brewing', 'As a Fort Lauderdale area native I began brewing at home in 1993. What began as a simple system on the kitchen stove yielding 5 gallons of beer soon led to a much more sophisticated brewing system welded together by a friend (paid in beer). With a 20 gallon fire brewed system in place I was definitely getting carried away with my passion. Brewing on my back patio, sometimes double batches (40 gallons), I studied every book available on the subject. In my travels I toured hundreds of breweries and developed lasting friendships with other brewers who like me, shared in the enjoyment of their craft. After winning quite a number of local contests and even brewing my recipes at a local brewpub on a larger scale, I decided to enter the Samuel Ada ms sponsored World Homebrew Contest with my &quot;extra special bitter&quot;. Out of 800 plus contestants I was one of 10 chosen as semifinalists and flown to Boston to brew my beer on their system. In the end I was one of three selected winners with a free trip to Europe, a cash prize and my recipe being bottled and distributed in the marketplace under the &quot;Longshot&quot; label. It was a great feeling of accomplishment personally, but beyond that I was also proud to be the second brewer in a row from Florida to win this prize. In my brewing journey I have met so many talented brewers from Florida. Fast forward some 10 years and after encouragement from my friends (taste testers) Holy Mackerel Beers was born. At Holy Mackerel Beers we  love beer whether drinking it, brewing it or simply talking about it. We are not just another marketing company. We test brew every beer we produce many times over on a small pilot system, at an undisclosed location, before it goes into full scale production at two small batch breweries in the southeast. Only then is it brewed under our strict supervision and according to our specifications.', 2012,

For 140euro &gt;365 crowdfunders had the opportunity to get 12 beers every year … for their entire life. Now we are looking at building a new micro-brewery in Brussels. In the meantime we are glad to brew our beers at Bier Anders. More news to come soon…', 2012,
