# Contributions

## What to work on

Everything we would like help on we mark with a "help wanted" label. 
If you haven't contributed yet, these are typically good items to 
get your feet wet.

## Pull requests

When making a pull request, either link to it in the commit message
or within the PR itself. Once the PR is merged, we'll close out the
issue.
